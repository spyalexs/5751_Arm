To set a servo ID:

The servo has a default address of 1 so any servo with that ID must be unplugged or multiple servo IDs will be changed.

Plug servo into arduino and open a serial connection between the laptop and the arduino. (Make sure the servo's ground is the arduino's ground).

Load the set servo ID code onto the arduino and follow the promts given by the code.

You may need to do this process more than once, slightly finicky.

Be sure to reload base code onto arduino after completion.
